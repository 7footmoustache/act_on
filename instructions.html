Client side HTML / JS / CSS questions:
<br>
 


Q3: Given an input JSON collection...
<br>
 
<!-- var dataEmployees = JSON object below -->
<!-- SAL :  use jquery to break it apart: jQuery.parseJSON() -->

<!-- SAL: Have to assume that the JSON statement is properly created. --> 
employees: [<br>

    { firstName: ..., lastName: ..., age: ... }<br>

]<br>

<!-- HTML table  -->

1. First need to pull the data out of the JSON collection (into a jquery object?)
2. Need to combine first and last name, ditch the rest of the data. then populate table.
2. Need to sort alphabetically from (z to a), unless share a name (a to z).  [Johnson, Amy] 
2. Next determine how many rows (nRows) are needed from an input.
3. Divide the total numbers of employees by how many rows. nRow/employee.length.
4. 



... dynamically populate an HTML table with employee names columnwise.<br>

i.e. top to bottom then left to right.<br>

Highlight every 4th name in red text.<br>  <!-- change class of 4th rows in css?
 -->
 

The number of rows in the table are fixed as an input variable 1 <= nRows <= 100.<br>

The number of columns are dynamically calculated to accommodate all employees to be displayed.<br>

 

For example, if nRows = 30 and there are 100 employees in the collection,<br>

display 1 to 30 in column 1, <br>

31 to 60 in column 2, <br>

61 to 90 in column 3 and <br>

91 onwards in column 4.<br>

In certain cases, not all cells will be populated i.e. if (employee count) < (rows x columns)<br>

 

Make sure the names are sorted alphabetically on lastName (descending z to a).<br>

If two employees have the same lastName, sort on firstName (ascending--normal).<br>

 

Note:<br>

A] This must be built using HTML, JS, CSS only.<br>

You cannot use any server side constructs.<br>

B] You may optionally use jQuery (http://jquery.com/) or Handlebars (http://handlebarsjs.com/)<br>

No other JS or CSS libraries may be used.<br>

 

Q4: Create a table (5 columns, 40 rows, 1 x row header, 1 x column header) programmatically using jQuery.<br>

Populate this table with auto generated data for each cell i.e. 15 alphanumeric characters (excluding vowels and numbers 0 and 1).<br>

Cell (row=17; column=3) must contain special text as follows:<br>

a] One English word, <br>

b] One Korean word (from http://www.unicode.org/standard/translations/korean.html) and <br>

c] The text (including the angled brackets and double quotes): <my name is "acton"><br>

The table border should be single / solid / red.<br>

Each cell's border should be single / solid / blue.<br>

Padding within each cell should be 5 pixels.<br>

Center this table horizontally on the screen - screen resizes should cause the table to auto reposition itself.<br>

Highlight odd rows and even rows in a different color using pure CSS.<br>

Add an absolute positioned DIV partially over this table containing text: Hello World <br>

Rendered this text vertically i.e. rotated 90 deg to the left<br>

Submit this solution as a single HTML file (with embedded CSS and JS) - no additional files.<br>
